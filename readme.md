This repository contains sample tests to be run in a pipeline as well as tests designed to monitor the system itself (the Jenkins pipeline, the Elastic monitoring, and the integration into the cloud). The repository should also contain templates and documentation for the instantiation of a pipeline on Azure.

This is currently in development.
